# Ajman Economic Growth — Data Visualization Project

🏆 **1st Place — Ajman Data Visualization Challenge 2025**

This project presents an interactive visual analysis of Ajman’s economic growth through business licenses, trade flows, investor diversity, and infrastructure pressure (waste generation), using open government data.
